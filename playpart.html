        <p>[The same room. The mist still lies heavy over the landscape.]</p>
        <p>[MANDERS and MRS. ALVING enter from the dining-room.]</p>
        <p>MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] <p1>Aren't
you coming too, Oswald?</p1>

<h6>OSWALD</h6>. <p>[From within.] </p> <p>No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.</p>

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6> <p1>Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now.</p1> <p>[She
shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] </p> Regina!<br>

<h6>REGINA</h6>. <p>[Outside.]</p> <p1>Yes, Mrs. Alving?</p1>

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6> <p1>Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.</p1>

<p>[MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]</p>

<h6>MANDERS.</h6> <p1>I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?</p1>

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6> <p1>Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.</p1>

<h6>MANDERS.</h6> <p1>I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
    morsel of dinner.</p1>

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6> <p>[Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.]</p> 
<p1>Nor I.
    But what is to be done now?
    </p1>
<h6>MANDERS.</h6> <p1>Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
    utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</p1>

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6> <p1>I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.</p1>

<h6>MANDERS.</h6> <p1>No; heaven forbid! But it is an unseemly state of things,
    nevertheless.</p1>

<h6>MRS. ALVING. </h6> <p1>It is only an idle fancy on Oswald's part; you may be sure
    of that.</p1>

<h6>MANDERS. </h6> <p1>Well, as I say, I am not accustomed to affairs of the kind. But
    I should certainly think--</p1>
