            [ENGSTRAND, the carpenter, stands by the garden door. His left leg
            is somewhat bent; he has a clump of wood under the sole of his boot.
            REGINA, with an empty garden syringe in her hand, hinders him from
            advancing.]
            
            REGINA. [In a low voice.] What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
            positively dripping.
            
            ENGSTRAND. It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.
            
            REGINA. It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.
            
            ENGSTRAND. Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into
            the room.] It's just this as I wanted to say--
            
            REGINA. Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
            master's asleep upstairs.
            
            ENGSTRAND. Asleep? In the middle of the day?
            
            REGINA. It's no business of yours.
            
            ENGSTRAND. I was out on the loose last night--
            
            REGINA. I can quite believe that.
            
            ENGSTRAND. Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--
            
            REGINA. So it seems.
            
            ENGSTRAND.--and temptations are manifold in this world, you see. But all
            the same, I was hard at work, God knows, at half-past five this morning.
            
            REGINA. Very well; only be off now. I won't stop here and have
            _rendezvous's_ [Note: This and other French words by Regina are in that
            language in the original] with you.
            
            ENGSTRAND. What do you say you won't have?
            
            REGINA. I won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your
            business.
