        <p class="hover">[The same room. The mist still lies heavy over the landscape.]</p>
        <p class="hover">[MANDERS and MRS. ALVING enter from the dining-room.]</p>
        <p class="hover">MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ </p>
        <p class="hover">[Note: A phrase equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait on appetite.]</p>
        <h5 class="mander">Mr. Manders.</h5>  
        <p class="hover">[Turns back towards the dining-room.] </p>
        <p1 class="speech">Aren't you coming too, Oswald?</p1>

<h5 class="Oswald">OSWALD</h5>.
 <p class="hover">[From within.] </p> 
 <p1 class="speech">No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.</p1>

<h5 class="alving">MRS. ALVING.</h5> 
<p1 class="speech">Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now.</p1> 
<p class="hover">[She shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] </p>
 Regina!

<h5 class="regina">REGINA</h5>. 
<p class="hover">[Outside.]</p> 
<p1 class="speech">Yes, Mrs. Alving?</p1>

<h5 class="alving">MRS. ALVING.</h5>
 <p1 class="speech">Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.</p1>

<h5 class="regina">REGINA.</h5>
 <p1 class="speech">Yes, Mrs. Alving.</p1>

<p class="hover">[MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]</p>

<h5 class="mander">MANDERS.</h5> 
<p1 class="speech">I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?</p1>

<h5 class="alving">MRS. ALVING.</h5> 
<p1 class="speech">Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.</p1>

<h5 class="mander">MANDERS.</h5> 
<p1 class="speech">I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
    morsel of dinner.</p1>

<h5 class="alving">MRS. ALVING.</h5> 
<p class="hover">[Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.]</p> 
<p1 class="speech">Nor I.
    But what is to be done now?
    </p1>
<h5 class="mander">MANDERS.</h5> 
<p1 class="speech">Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
    utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</p1>

<h5 class="alving">MRS. ALVING.</h5> 
<p1 class="speech">I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.</p1>

<h5 class="mander">MANDERS.</h5> 
<p1 class="speech">No; heaven forbid! But it is an unseemly state of things,
    nevertheless.</p1>

<h5 class="alving">MRS. ALVING. </h5> 
<p1 class="speech">It is only an idle fancy on Oswald's part; you may be sure
    of that.</p1>

<h5 class="mander">MANDERS. </h5>
